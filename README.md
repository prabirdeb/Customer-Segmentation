# Summary:

The task was to explore and analyze an unlabeled dataset on the transaction details of online retail customers, transactions were occurring between 01/12/2010 and 09/12/2011 for a UK-based and registered non-store online retail and to build a clustering model for customer segmentation.

Created ‘Mean_UnitPrice’  and ‘Sum_Quantity’ features for each ‘CustomerID’ because, from the average unit price, we could understand what they buy, and from the sum of quantity, we could understand how much they buy.

Employed some of the most widely used clustering algorithms for this project namely;

**1.	KMeans**

**2.	AgglomerativeClustering**

**3.	GaussianMixture**

Final model was KMeans model for online retail customer segmentation, as it was best fitting our expected customer segmentation with minimum overlap among all three models.
